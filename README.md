# Gym-Hero
A website about gym called "Gym Hero", which showcase thier work and thierand thier blog.

## The Idea behind this poject 💡
I love working out in my spare time, so i thougth, why not make a website about gym. The color theme is dark gray, blue and white. The pictures in the website were important, because it attracts the person to visit this made up Gym.

## What I learned 🧠
- To combine colors and images so they fit well togethter
- The `flexbox` properties
- Heavily focused on creating lot's of different `transitions` and working with the `transform` property
- How to create a good looking pricing table (membership package)
